I'm Anirudh Reddy and I am a computer science major at California State University, Northridge. While I am primarily skilled in User Experience design and Software Engineering, I am currently learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning and its place in business processes that continue to increase employee functions, productivity, and their effect on customers. I am looking to develop this interest in AI and hopefully further expand my knowledge into different sectors and industries, typically pertaining towards the arts, robotics, mathematics, and possibly more.
